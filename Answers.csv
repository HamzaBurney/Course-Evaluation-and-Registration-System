Variables and Data Types,d,t,A variable in programming is a named container that can hold a value. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data. For example in Python we can declare a variable named age and assign it a value like 25: age = 25.
Variables and Data Types,b,t, A variable can hold different values during program execution and its value can be changed while a constant represents a fixed value that does not change throughout the program.
Variables and Data Types,c,t,In most programming languages a variable is declared by specifying its name and optionally its data type. For example in C++ you can declare an integer variable named num as follows: int num
Variables and Data Types,b,t,The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible. It determines where and how long a variable can be used. Variables can have local scope (limited to a specific block or function) or global scope (accessible throughout the entire program).
Variables and Data Types,c,f,Common rules for naming variables include using descriptive names starting with a letter or underscore avoiding reserved keywords and using camel case or underscores to separate words.
Control Structures,d,t,The while loop checks the condition before executing the loop body while the do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop body. This means that the do-while loop always executes the loop body at least once even if the condition is false.
Control Structures,c,t,The switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression. It evaluates the expression and compares it with the values of the case labels. When a match is found the corresponding code block is executed. The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after a match.
Control Structures,c,f,A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known in advance and it consists of three parts: initialization condition and increment/decrement. The initialization step is executed only once at the beginning the condition is checked before each iteration and the increment/decrement step is executed at the end of each iteration. In contrast a while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It only checks the condition before each iteration and does not have a separate initialization or increment/decrement step.
Control Structures,c,t,Nested control structures refer to the situation where one control structure is placed within another control structure. For example we can have an if statement nested inside a while loop. This allows for more complex decision-making and repetition patterns in a program.
Control Structures,b,t,Some common mistakes include forgetting to include necessary curly braces or indentation leading to incorrect code blocks being executed. Another mistake is using assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) in conditions. 
Functions,c,f,A function parameter is a variable declared in the function definition that represents a value to be passed into the function. An argument on the other hand is the actual value that is passed into the function when it is called. In simple terms a parameter is a placeholder and an argument is the actual value that fills that placeholder.
Functions,c,f,In most programming languages a function is defined by providing a function name a set of parameters (optional) and the function body.
Functions,c,t,The return statement is used to end the execution of a function and return a value (if specified) to the caller. It allows the function to provide an output that can be stored or used for further calculations. On the other hand the print statement is used to display output on the screen or console
Functions,c,t,A void function often used in languages like C/C++ is a function that does not return any value. Instead of using a return statement the function simply executes its code and then terminates. Void functions are typically used when the function is intended to perform some action or task without needing to return a value.
Functions,a,f,In most programming languages an array can be passed as a parameter to a function by specifying the array name as the parameter along with the appropriate data type.

Inheritance,a,f,The virtual keyword is used to define a virtual function in a base class. When a derived class overrides the virtual function the virtual keyword ensures that the most derived function is called based on the actual type of the object rather than the declared type of the pointer or reference.

Polymorphism,a,t,Function overloading is a feature of C++ that allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to coexist in the same scope. The compiler selects the appropriate function based on the number types and order of arguments in the function call.
